A schema is a set of objects (tables, indexes, views, etc) that belong to a user. 
In Oracle, a user can be considered the same as a schema. A database instance can have
multiple users/schemas. A table as an object can be accessed from the current user's
schema or from a different schema, when provided with proper access privileges.

So when we run the query by referencing it as SchemaName.TableName, It 
points to the TableName owned by user SchemaName.

When we directly refer to the TableName (as select * from TableName), 
two things could be possible.

* There is a table by the name TableName in your current schema.
* There is a table by the name TableName in another schema and a public
synonym is created for the table.
